\chapter{Introduction}

This book is aimed at introducing graduate and undergraduate students
in engineering to the applications of Lie groups theory that are 
relevant to engineering. Instead of focusing on the abstract 
mathematics initially, it will build intuition by traversing the most
fundamental Lie Groups in robotics.

\section{What is a Lie Group}

\begin{definition}
A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)}{Group} is a set G
and an associated operator $\cdot$ that is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{C}losed: if $a \in G$ and $b \in G$, then $a \cdot b \in G$
	\item \textbf{A}ssociative: $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
    \item \textbf{I}nverse: $a^{-1}\cdot a = e$
    \item \textbf{N}eutral: $a \cdot e = a$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group}{Lie Group} is a group that
    is also a differentiable manifold.
    \end{definition}

A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold}{differentiable manifold}
is a topological space resemlbling Euclidean space near each point
and locally similar enough to a vector space to apply calculus. Originally Lie Groups were called infinitesmal groups by the creator
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophus_Lie}{Sophus Lie} (pronounced Lee).
The can be thought of as groups of continuous transformations.

\chapter{The $SO(2)$ Lie Group}
%
\section{Group Representation}
%
$SO(2)$ can be represented by any matrix of the from:
%
$$G(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta} \\
\sin{\theta} & \cos{\theta}
\end{bmatrix}$$
with the Group operator of matrix multiplication ($\cdot$), where $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$.

To show that $SO(2)$ is a Lie Group, we much show that it is closed, associative, has inverse, and a neutral element and is a differentiable manifold

\subsection*{Closed}
%
Since $G(\theta_1) \cdot G(\theta_2) = G(\theta_1 + \theta_2)$, $SO(2)$ is \textbf{closed} under matrix multiplication.

\subsection*{Associative}
%
$SO(2)$ as a Matrix Lie Group, can inheret associativity from matrix multiplication:
%
$$(A \cdot B) \cdot C = A \cdot (B \cdot C)$$

\subsection*{Inverse}
%
$SO(2)$ as a Matrix Lie Group, can inheret the inverse from matrix multiplication, since any element of $SO(2)$ has a non-zero determinant (1) and is invertible.
%
$$\det{G} = \cos^2{\theta} + \sin^2{\theta} = 1$$
%
Because the columns of $G(\theta)$ are orthonomal, the inverse is given by the matrix transpose.
%
$$G^{-1}(\theta) = G^T(\theta)$$

\subsection*{Neutal}
%
$SO(2)$ as a Matrix Lie Group, can inheret the neutral element from matrix multiplication, $I$.
%
$$A\cdot I = A$$

\subsection*{Differential Manifold}
Is is clear that the group $SO(2)$ is continuous as it inherits this from $\mathbb{R}$.
$G(\theta)$, $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$.
We will see in the Lie Algebra that the group is locally similar to 1 dimensional Euclidean space
and we can perform calculus.


\section{Lie Algebra}
%
For matrix Lie groups, we can always find an element of the Lie Algebra, $\Omega$ via:
%
$$\dot{G} = G\Omega$$
%
$$\Omega = G^{-1}\dot{G}$$
%
The so2 Lie algebra can be represented by all 2x2 skew symmetric matrices of the form:
%
$$\Omega = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & - \omega\\
\omega & 0
\end{bmatrix}$$
%
It is convenient to define a wedge operator such that:

\begin{definition}[The Wedge Operator]
$$\mathbb{R} \mapsto so(2)$$
$$\omega^{\wedge} = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & - \omega\\
    \omega & 0
    \end{bmatrix}$$
\end{definition}
%
It is also convient to define a vee operator, the inverse of the wedge operator such that:
%
\begin{definition}[The Vee Operator]
$$so(2) \mapsto \mathbb{R}$$
$$\begin{bmatrix}
0 & - \omega\\
\omega & 0
\end{bmatrix}^{\vee} = \omega$$
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[The Lie Group Exponential Map]
The Lie group Exponential map maps from the Lie algebra to the Lie group.
For matrix Lie groups, such as $SO(2)$ it is given by the matrix
exponential.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[The Lie Group Logarithm Map]
The Lie group logarithm map maps from the Lie group to the Lie algebra.
For matrix Lie groups, such as $SO(2)$ it is given by the matrix
logarithm, the inverse of the matrix exponential.
\end{definition}

    \caption{Transformation of a Vector Field from the Lie Group to the Lie Algebra}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Bijective/Invertible Map]
A map is bijective or invertible if it is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item One-one/ injective: For each point in the domain there is one point in the range.
    \item Onto/ surjective: Each point in the range is mapped to by a point in the domain.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

It is often beneficial for us to map vector fields to the Lie algebra to simplify
analysis. If we do this, we desire an invertible map, so after we take the logarithm,
we can then take the exponential of the Lie algebra to obtain results in the Lie group.
We will see later how this can be used for reachable set computation. It is important
to note that the matrix exponential is not one to one. A single point in the range, can be
reached by multiple points in the domain, since for $so(2)$, the Lie algebra parameter $\theta$ 
and $\theta + 2\pi k$, $k\in \mathbb{Z}$, map to the same point. However, we can restrict the
comain of the map to $\{-\pi, \pi\}$ and the map is invertible in this domain.
